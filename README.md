This is a .bat file that easily cleans up all shaders without deleting your settings like Vulkan or DX11 renderer option in Star Citizen. 

How to use : 
Double click on the .bat file and the cleanup will be done automatically. 
The window will show you which folders are being deleted and then close after that.

Supports Star Citizen 3.23.x and older.
